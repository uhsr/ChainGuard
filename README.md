# ChainGuard: Securing Your Go Applications

ChainGuard is a Go library designed to provide a robust, flexible, and easily integrable framework for security auditing and enforcement within your Go applications. It allows developers to define and apply security policies, detect and mitigate potential vulnerabilities, and ensure adherence to best security practices throughout the application lifecycle.

This library aims to simplify the process of building secure applications by offering a clear, declarative approach to security configuration. Instead of scattering security checks throughout your codebase, ChainGuard centralizes policy definition and enforcement. It leverages middleware patterns, custom validation functions, and configurable rules to provide a comprehensive security layer that can be applied to various application components, including API endpoints, data access layers, and background processes. ChainGuard is built with performance in mind, using efficient algorithms and caching mechanisms to minimize overhead. Its modular design allows developers to selectively enable or disable specific security features, tailoring the library to their specific needs and resource constraints. Furthermore, ChainGuard provides detailed logging and reporting capabilities, enabling developers to track security events, identify potential weaknesses, and ensure compliance with security regulations.

ChainGuard goes beyond simple input validation and authorization. It provides advanced features such as rate limiting, cross-site scripting (XSS) protection, SQL injection prevention, and detection of common web application vulnerabilities. The library also includes support for custom security policies, allowing developers to implement bespoke security requirements based on their specific application context. By using ChainGuard, developers can significantly reduce the risk of security breaches, enhance the overall security posture of their applications, and demonstrate a commitment to secure coding practices. It simplifies the process of building secure software and gives you confidence that your application is protected against common threats.

## Key Features

*   **Policy-Based Security:** Define security policies using a declarative configuration format (e.g., YAML, JSON) and apply them consistently across your application. Policies can specify allowed input formats, authorization rules, rate limits, and other security constraints.
*   **Middleware Integration:** Seamlessly integrate ChainGuard into your existing Go applications using middleware patterns. Apply security checks to specific API endpoints or application components without modifying existing code. Example: `chainGuardMiddleware := ch.NewChainGuardMiddleware(config); http.HandleFunc("/api/secure", chainGuardMiddleware(secureHandler))`
*   **Custom Validation Functions:** Extend ChainGuard with custom validation functions to implement application-specific security checks. These functions can be used to validate input data, enforce business rules, and detect anomalies.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Protect your application from denial-of-service attacks by implementing rate limiting based on IP address, user ID, or other criteria. Configure rate limits using a flexible configuration format. Example: `config.RateLimit.Enabled = true; config.RateLimit.RequestsPerMinute = 100`
*   **XSS Protection:** Automatically sanitize user input to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. ChainGuard includes built-in filters to remove or encode potentially malicious characters from user-provided data.
*   **SQL Injection Prevention:** Employ parameterized queries and input validation techniques to prevent SQL injection attacks. ChainGuard provides utilities to help developers write secure database queries.
*   **Detailed Logging and Reporting:** Generate comprehensive logs of security events, including policy violations, detected vulnerabilities, and authentication attempts. These logs can be used for auditing, incident response, and compliance reporting.

## Technology Stack

*   **Go:** The primary programming language used to develop the ChainGuard library.
*   **net/http:** Go's standard library package for building HTTP servers and clients. Used for middleware integration and request handling.
*   **YAML/JSON (optional):** Used for defining security policies in a declarative format. Libraries like `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` or `encoding/json` can be used for parsing these files.
*   **Context:** Go's context package is used throughout the library for managing request lifecycle, timeouts, and cancellation.

## Installation

1.  Ensure you have Go installed and configured on your system. Minimum Go version is 1.18.
2.  Create a new Go module or use an existing one.
3.  Use `go get` to install the ChainGuard library:

    `go get github.com/uhsr/ChainGuard`
4.  Import the ChainGuard package into your Go code:

    `import "github.com/uhsr/ChainGuard"`

## Configuration

ChainGuard can be configured using environment variables or a configuration file (YAML or JSON). The following environment variables are supported:

*   `CHAINGUARD_CONFIG_PATH`: Path to the configuration file. If not specified, ChainGuard will use default settings.
*   `CHAINGUARD_LOG_LEVEL`: Log level (e.g., `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`). Defaults to `info`.
*   `CHAINGUARD_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED`: Enables or disables rate limiting (true/false). Defaults to `false`.

A sample YAML configuration file:



## Usage

Import the ChainGuard package: `import "github.com/uhsr/ChainGuard"`. Initialize ChainGuard with the configuration file path or use the default configuration. Example:


Create a middleware function to apply the security policies. This middleware intercepts incoming requests, applies the defined security rules, and either allows or rejects the request. Example:
